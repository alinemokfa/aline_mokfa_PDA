employers across Scotland and accredited by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) - as
part of its core course.

## The Qualification
This PDA has been designed as a Group Award to enable students to achieve internationally
recognised credits as determined by the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) -
the national framework that describes all relevant programmes of learning and qualifications in
Scotland.
Students on the core 16­week course will be offered the opportunity to complete Level 8 (SQA

Equivalent to HND/ Diploma of Higher Education and suitable for
those with some previous knowledge of computing, eg an HNC, or a graduate - level
qualification in a non-STEM area.

###Qualification Structure
The qualification is hierarchical in nature. To achieve the PDA Group Award, learners are
required to pass all three Units within the specified level, they are:
Software Development: Analysis & Design
Software Development: Implementation & Testing
Software Development: Project
For example, all three Units would need to be completed with a pass at Level 8 to obtain the
Level 8 Group Award.

###Achieving the PDA qualification ­- Assessment Overview
CodeClan will provide students on their core course the opportunity to prepare for and
undertake appropriate assessment activities in order to achieve the Units leading to the Group
Award. Students will be assigned a designated Assessor who will review their progress at
regular intervals and facilitate assessment activities. Evidence of achievement may be gathered
through work undertaken as part of the learning and teaching, or by scheduled assessments set
by the centre at CodeClan’s discretion.
