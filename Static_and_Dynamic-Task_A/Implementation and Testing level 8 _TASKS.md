#### Task 1: Static Testing

	Carry out static testing on the attached text file of code (testing_task_1.rb).  

	Read through the code. Comment any errors you can see but do not correct them in this file.



#### Task 2: Dynamic Testing

	You will be given a ruby file with the code you have looked over in task 1 (testing_task_2.rb).  

	Open up the file and correct the errors you spotted in task 1.  

	Carry out dynamic testing on the code. Correct any errors you find.
	
	

Save the files and corrected code to your PDA github repo.
